# ML_NLP_Depression_Prediction_Tweets
Made by Aditi and Molshree using Naive Bayes Classifier 
<p>Our project focused on predicting the level of depression in individuals based on their Twitter tweets, employing Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The key algorithm utilized was the Naive Bayes Classifier, which we implemented from scratch. The methodology involved data preprocessing, including the removal of stop words and extraneous characters. Additionally, each word underwent lemmatization to enhance the accuracy of the analysis.

The training process involved fitting the model with the provided train.csv dataset, allowing the Naive Bayes Classifier to learn and discern patterns related to depression levels. Subsequently, we applied the trained model to predict depression levels for the test.csv dataset.

To visualize our results, we leveraged Matplotlib to create a pie chart. This chart effectively illustrates the distribution of individuals across different depression levels. The segments of the pie chart represent the percentages of individuals classified into categories such as severe depression, moderate depression, and no depression at all. This visualization offers a clear and concise overview of the predicted depression levels within the analyzed Twitter data.</p>
